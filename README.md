In this project we begin with a grid of face-down cards in this  memory card game. To turn the cards over and look for matching pairs, we simply tap. The cards flip back down if they don't match, and vanish if they do. To start over and mix the cards, we can reset the game. Along with enjoying a vibrant and dynamic interface,we may also select how many pairs to play with and navigate among the cards if there are too many to view at once.
